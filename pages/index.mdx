# Kakise's Blog

Hola ! My name is Kakise and I am currently working as an Embedded System Software Engineer. I mainly use C++ at work and for academic research. I also code in Python and
I used to use TypeScript/React in my previous position.

Here I will post about my various projects and findings.

I started programming when I was a kid and kept the passion ever since. I've been contributing to some open-source projects here and there and I am currently the maintainer
of the following repos:

- A Dyson integration to interface locally with your Dyson devices in homeassistant [@shenxn/ha-dyson](https://github.com/shenxn/ha-dyson)
- A Dyson library to communicate with Dyson devices in your network [@shenxn/libdyson](https://github.com/shenxn/libdyson)

And I previously made a homebridge plugin to have Tuya door sensors in HomeKit but it got depreceated since the release of the official Tuya homebridge plugin.
